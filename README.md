## Creating New Levels

You can find all the levels in the [Maps](https://github.com/hnqca/PixelAdventure2D-UE5/tree/main/PixelAdventure2D-UE5/Content/PixelAdventure/Maps) directory.

To create a new level, simply duplicate an existing level and rename it following the numerical sequence. For example: "**Level_17**," "**Level_18**," and so on. This will ensure that the player is automatically teleported to the corresponding next level.

## üçâ Setting the Number of Fruits to Collect in the Level:

Simply drag and drop the actor "[BP_Pickup_Fruit](https://github.com/hnqca/PixelAdventure2D-UE5/blob/main/PixelAdventure2D-UE5/Content/PixelAdventure/Actors/Pickups/BP_Pickup_Fruit.uasset)" anywhere in the level. You can add as many fruits as you want.
